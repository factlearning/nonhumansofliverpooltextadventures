waterfronts in the world, Liverpool. I&#39;m very useful to the city allowing
ships (ferries, container ships, cruise ships, tall ships, leisure boats) access.
I&#39;m so clean now [[see what lives in me]] or [[visit my interesting points]]

position="337,399" size="100,100">I&#39;m home to lots of aquatic plants and
fish. Fishermen come to catch cod, salmon and mackerel. Seals and dolphins play
in my water and follow boats and a whale sneaked in one year to have a look
round. When the sun shines humans and their dogs like to swim in me. I&#39;ll
tell you about [[my tunnels]] or you can visit [[my beaches]]</tw-passagedata>
