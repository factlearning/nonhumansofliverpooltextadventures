day by the tide although sometimes that river leaves nasty things. The river is
my mate but I have to keep reminding it to take the rubbish with it. There are
different types of beach [[I can tell you what they are]]</tw-passagedata><tw-

(children love the rock pools), sand dunes (sometimes used in golf courses),
mudflats (handy for mussel farmers) and sandbanks (these tend to irritate the
boats!).My favourite is the flat, sandy beach [[do you want to know why?]]</tw-

my beaches but when the weather is nice lots of humans come to play on my flat,
sandy beach. I love the castles and buildings the humans make using my sand and
they use my surface for games like volleyball and sand-surfing. It&#39;s such
fun. I do have a few gripes though [[can you guess what annoys me?]]</tw-

sand all over the place, it takes ages to put back again. some boats release oil
which dirties me and is hard to get rid of. But the worst thing is all the
rubbish left by the humans. It makes me look awful and can smell disgusting. I
really wish they would take everything away with them. I have to think of some
way to stop this. I need to enlist help [[can you help me set up a plan?]]</tw-
